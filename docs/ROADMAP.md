## Recently Completed (December 2025)

### Database Portability ✅
- Created `DatabaseCompatibilityService` for MySQL 8.4+, PostgreSQL 13+, SQLite 3.35+ support
- Refactored `SalesAnalytics` to use portable date/time operations
- Eliminated PostgreSQL-specific EXTRACT() and DATE_TRUNC() usage

### Code Cleanup Phase 1 ✅
- Removed 18 unused classes (2 events, 3 jobs, 2 traits, 2 observers, 1 exception, 4 rules, 4 policies)
- Eliminated ~800+ lines of dead code
- Archived 45 AI-generated documentation files
- Retained only 6 core documentation files + ROADMAP

### Code Cleanup Phase 2 ✅
- Fixed Product form to load currencies from database (not hardcoded)
- Optimized currency loading with caching to avoid repeated DB queries
- Fixed ProductObserver to reference correct column names (default_price, standard_cost)
- Fixed ProductUpdateRequest validation (categories → product_categories)
- Removed non-existent returns/create routes for Sales and Purchases
- Fixed permission naming inconsistencies (rentals→rental, hr→hrm)

### Settings, Forms, and DB Alignment ✅ (December 2025)
- Added unit_id field and unit() relationship to Product model
- Added category and unit select fields to Product form with quick-add links
- Fixed Sales form field name consistency (reference_number → reference_no)
- Added category_id and unit_id support to ProductService
- Verified all forms use Currency model correctly (Sales, Purchases, Products)
- Ensured all quick-add routes exist and permissions are aligned
- Validated all table/column names match between migrations and code
